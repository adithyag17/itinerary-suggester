# OCD ISSUES I HAVE 

## 1. Web Scraping Tools 🕵️‍♂️  
Use **Scrapy, Selenium, and MechanicalSoup** instead of **BeautifulSoup**—they are much more powerful. These scrapers, if implemented properly, have the capability of parsing CAPTCHA tests and even scraping secured websites for bots (*kinda illegal tho* 😏).  

## 2. API Key Management 🔑  
Hmmm, API key as a variable? How about we **don’t push that into Git** and reveal it to all of my 3 followers, letting them use up my API? 🙂  
Better to use a **`.env` file** so that we securely don’t expose keys in code, eh?  

## 3. Docker Best Practices 🐳  
Lovely to see **Dockerfiles** being used! PS: A better way would be to use **Docker Compose files**, right?  

## 4. FastAPI vs Flask ⚡  
How about we use **FastAPI instead of Flask**? It provides **Swagger UI support**, helps with **automated boilerplate generation**, and makes API testing much easier.  

## 5. Next.js Deployment Strategy ☁️  
Hmmm, **Next.js on Vercel**—ah, the **Vercel deployment trick**! Love it! But what if we **containerize and deploy it over an EC2 instance** on AWS or another CSP? That would make it **much more industry-relevant**, right?
